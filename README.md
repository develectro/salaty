<!-- ## 🛠️ Setup and Local Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/SalatyDevelopment.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this is a static web application, you don't need a complex build process. You can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    However, for the best experience and to avoid potential browser security issues with API calls (CORS), it's recommended to serve the files using a local web server. If you have VS Code, the Live Server extension is an excellent choice.
